## Preparation Phase

### PowerPoint Basics

#### Font 
  + Using **Sans Serif** fonts instead of **Serif** fonts makes it easier for the audience to read the text quickly. Examples of Sans Serif fonts include *Arial*, *Comic Sans*, and *Trebuchet*
  + Type size should be within the range of 18 point to 36 point, except adding references at the bottom
  + Avoid using all capital letters
  

#### Color
  + The color combination between letters and background should be **high contrast**
    + A dark blue or black background works best for talks in a large room
    + Dark letters against a light background are best for small rooms or teaching
  + There is no need for a university logo to be on each slide

#### Layout
  + Every slide should have a heading, a **simple but purposeful** sentence. For more effective headers, consider:
    + Using questions as headers to simulate a "conversation"
    + Using the assertion-evidence structure
  + Limit text blocks to no more than **two** lines each
  + Lists should contain no more than **3** items, and "unveil" the list one by one
  + Be generous with empty space, especially at the top and the bottom

#### Style
  + Include a simple image on every slide
  + Limit the number of items on each slide; each slide should make just one or two points, and explain the points completely
    + If you're not going to take the time to explain it, get rid of it
  + Avoid fancy transitions between slides unless you have a good reason
  + Don't drown the audience with data, less is more


### Three Functions of Slides 
+ **Visual repetition** of key points: to draw attention to & reinforce key messages
+ **Complement** spoken text: additional info not said
+ **Replace Speaker** (temporarily): e.g., a video, show whole paragraph or table & ask audience to read while keeping silent

### The structure of slides: start broad, get specific, end broad
+ Start with the biggest questions and get progressively more specific
+ In the middle of the talk, go into depth, but use the home slide to make transitions (enable the audience to tune back in)
+ To conclude, reiterate the main conclusions and go back to the big picture
+ During Q&A, put the summary slide back up again

### Review Each Slide
+ Make sure each slide serves its PURPOSE
+ Each slide has MAIN POINTS thatthe  audience must see within 5 seconds
+ Check whether the slide will make the audience LISTEN or spend some time looking at the slide


## During Presentation

### Useful Slide Transition Wordings
+ "Now, what are ...?" (use of questions)
+ "My next point is ..."
+ "Now that I've finished talking about ..., let's move on to ..."
+ "You've just seen ..., so we'll now turn out attention to my second point: ..."
+ "In addition to the factors we have discussed, I want to add ..."

### Remind Vocal Dynamics
+ Change **pace** to emphasize key points
+ Change **pitch** to create interest
+ Change **volume** to emphasize contrast
+ **Punc-tu-ate** syllables and words for emphasis
+ **Pause** before important information to provide anticipation

### Avoid Vocal Distracters
+ Vocalized pauses (um.., er.., ah..)
+ Filler words (ok, you know, actually)
+ Breathlessness
+ Voice dropping or rising at the end of a sentence
+ Mumbling /slurring


## Q&A Session 

Different types of questions:
+ Clarification questions: dealing with points mentioned in the presentation
+ Application/Significance questions: relating to the value of research
+ Problem questions: regarding perceived problems with research;
+ Miscellaneous questions: concerning minor issues related to research

### Handling Questions

+ **When don't know the answer**: 
  + Simply say "I don't know, but...", to say what you would do the get the information to the asker
  + Or if you have the hunch, still say, "I don't know, but I will follow up with you as soon as I can." Then, follow with your hunch: "But my hunch is, the answer may sound like this..."

+ **When the multiple questions are asked one after another** (Machine gun questions):
  + Pick one or two that you still remember and answer them
  + Ask the asker to repeat the question

+ **May not be a question but a statement**:
  + When the people take a breath, start to paraphrase what has been said and ask a question for him/her: "So what you are saying is ... "

+ **When someone asks a question with loaded emotions**:
  + It's best to acknowledge the emotion in a generic term: "It sounds like you have a lot of passion on this topic..." and go ahead and paraphrase the question
